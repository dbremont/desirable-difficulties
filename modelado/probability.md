# Probability

- You have three children, but only one apple. You want to toss a fair coin to determine which child gets the apple. You want each child to be equally likely to get the apple. What is your strategy?
- You are blindfolded and faced with 100 coins on a table, 10 of which show heads and 90 show tails. Without being able to see the coins, how can you divide them into two groups such that each group has the same number of heads?
- **Amoeba population**: There is one amoeba in a pond. After every minute the amoeba may die, stay the same, split into two, or split into three with equal probability. All its offspring, if it has any, will behave the same (and independent of other amoebas).  **What is the probability the amoeba population will die out?**
- A certain disease affects 1% of the population. A diagnostic test for the disease has a **99% sensitivity** (i.e., it correctly identifies 99% of people who have the disease) and a **95% specificity** (i.e., it correctly identifies 95% of people who do not have the disease).

     A randomly selected person from the population takes the test and receives a **positive** result.

     **What is the probability that the person actually has the disease?**

- Suppose that for three fair dice. Denote the scores obtained by X1, X2 and X3. Find P(X1 +X2 +X3 â‰¤5).
- Two real numbers X and Y are chosen at random in the interval (0, 1).
Compute the probability that the closest integer to X/Y is even.
- `If every family has a child until a boy is born; what will the average proportion of boys to girls be?`

For each of the following scenarios, find the requested probability. Assume the sets $A, B,$ and $C$ are events from the same sample space $S$. (Hint: Venn diagrams may help with the visualization, although they are not required to answer the questions.)

If $P(A) = .4, P(B^c) = .7,$ and $P(A \cap B^c) = .2,$ find $P(A \cap B)$

Three popular options on a certain type of car are $A$ leather seats, $B$ a sunroof, and $C$ heated seats. In the past, $P(A) = 0.55$ (i.e. 55% of the customers have requested option $A$), $P(B) = 0.45, P(C) = 0.4$. Furthermore, $P(A \cap B) = 0.25, P(A \cap C) = 0.2, P(B \cap C) = 0.15$ and $P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.1$.

Find the probability that a customer will ask for at least one of the three options.

A message of length 5 digits is to be sent. Each digit can be a 0, 1, or 2.

What is the cardinality of the sample space?

---

A message of length 5 digits is to be sent. Each digit can be a 0, 1, or 2.

If every message is equally likely, what is the probability that the message consists of 2 zeros, 2 ones, and 1 two? Round your answer to have four decimal places.
