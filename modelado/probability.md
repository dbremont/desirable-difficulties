# Probability

- You have three children, but only one apple. You want to toss a fair coin to determine which child gets the apple. You want each child to be equally likely to get the apple. What is your strategy?
- You are blindfolded and faced with 100 coins on a table, 10 of which show heads and 90 show tails. Without being able to see the coins, how can you divide them into two groups such that each group has the same number of heads?
- **Amoeba population**: There is one amoeba in a pond. After every minute the amoeba may die, stay the same, split into two, or split into three with equal probability. All its offspring, if it has any, will behave the same (and independent of other amoebas).  **What is the probability the amoeba population will die out?**
- A certain disease affects 1% of the population. A diagnostic test for the disease has a **99% sensitivity** (i.e., it correctly identifies 99% of people who have the disease) and a **95% specificity** (i.e., it correctly identifies 95% of people who do not have the disease).

     A randomly selected person from the population takes the test and receives a **positive** result.

     **What is the probability that the person actually has the disease?**

- Suppose that for three fair dice. Denote the scores obtained by X1, X2 and X3. Find P(X1 +X2 +X3 â‰¤5).
- Two real numbers X and Y are chosen at random in the interval (0, 1).
Compute the probability that the closest integer to X/Y is even.
